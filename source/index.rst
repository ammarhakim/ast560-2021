AST560: Computational Plasma Physics 2021
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These are slides, notes and other materials for AST560 Spring 2021
course for the portion of the class taught by Ammar Hakim. These
lectures focus on finite-volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes for
partial differential equations (PDEs), specifically fluid mechanics
(Euler equations) and plasma physics (MHD equations, multi-fluid
equations and the Vlasov-Maxwell system). We will look at schemes
suited to shock dominated flows rather than problems on resistive
time-scales. Vast majority of laboratory, space and astrophysical
problems have complex interactions of shocks, turbulence and magnetic
fields and the schemes in these lectures will help you solve equation
to study such phenomena.

The final couple of lectures will be an introduction to implicit
methods to solve and couple diffusive and other non-ideal physics to
hyperbolic PDE solvers.

As reading for the lectures please read Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 5 in
[LeVeque1992]_. Some notes and references to material not completely
covered in class:

- van Dyke's "Album of Fluid Motion" is an excellent source of
  beautiful pictures of fluid flow. See `this link for a PDF of an
  older version
  <http://courses.washington.edu/me431/handouts/Album-Fluid-Motion-Van-Dyke.pdf>`_
  of the book.
- See eigensystem of Euler equations listed `here
  <http://ammar-hakim.org/sj/euler-eigensystem.html>`_ and Maxwell
  equations `here
  <http://ammar-hakim.org/sj/maxwell-eigensystem.html>`_.
- For ideal MHD equations the eigensystem is very complex. A listing
  is in [RyuJones1995]_ but it may be a good idea to rederive this and
  cross-check.

In addition to the complexity of the physics and the mathematics of
numerical methods, computational physics software is very complex. In
addition to the physics itself being complicated (multiple spatial and
temporal scales, highly nonlinear physics, coupling between models,
huge number of unknowns, etc), the algorithms required may be
sophisticated, difficult to implement efficiently and may require
complex data-structures. In general, to achieve expertise in this
topic one needs to write a lot of code under the supervision of a
"Master Craftsman". It is hard to learn the real details of the field
any other way.

A nice summary of the concepts of the finite-volume schemes is given
in the paper `"A one-sided view" <./_static/Roe-60th.pdf>`_ by Roe,
LeVeque and van Leer.

  "Gacha Life" character drawn by Sophia Hakim (10 YO) to represent
  homework character Fivo L. Hacker ("Finite Volume Hacker").

My goal in setting homework is to review material covered in
class. Due to the pandemic forced remote learning it is hard to focus
and learn as much as one really should in a class like this. I hope
these homework sets allow a review of the material and improve
learning in these very trying and difficult situations.

Some historical notes on hardware and key papers
------------------------------------------------

The first and perhaps greatest pioneer in computer hardware was
`Charles Babbage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage>`_. He
essentially, ab-inito, designed a series of mechanical computers,
culminating in the Analytical Engine. Most of Babbage's machines were
not built in his lifetime. However, his design for the Analytical
Engine contains all the modern architectural details found in our
processors (of course, Babbage worked with mechanical machines and not
electronics). By a stroke of misfortune (probably as Babbage never
published anything), Babbage's ideas were not widely known, and
especially his designs fell into obscurity. They were only
rediscovered in 1960s, much after the modern von Neumann architecture
was designed. That two independent designs made a century apart should
be so similar is remarkable.

`Allan Bromley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_G._Bromley>`_ is
the credited for rediscovering Babbage's legacy. See his `paper
<./_static/Bromley-1982.pdf>`_ in Annals of the History of Computing
for a detailed overview of the Analytical Engine. Babbage's Difference
engine has been built twice now. See `Computer History Museum page
<https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/>`_. Babbage also designed an
extraordinary printer which was also built by the Science
Museum. London. See `BBC news report
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/710950.stm>`_.

The von Neumann architecture is named after the polymath `John von
Neumann <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann>`_. He worked
on his designs over years, including at the Institute of Advanced
Study where he designed a machined called the `IAS Machine
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS_machine>`_. von Neumann and Herman
Goldstine wrote the first major paper on `error analysis of Gaussian
elimination <https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/080734716>`_, bringing
numerical analysis into the mainstream of applied mathematics.

`Moore's Law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law>`_ continues
to hold and number of transistors on-chip are doubling every two
years. However, we are hitting limit of clock speeds now and the way
towards faster computing is via multi-core machines. Many companies
ship chips with large number of cores. For example, Intel's `Cascade
Lake
<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/cascade-lake/2nd-gen-intel-xeon-scalable-processors.html>`_
architecture has upto 28 cores. AMD's `Epyc chips
<https://www.amd.com/en/processors/epyc-7002-series>`_ come with up to
64 cores. These are now becoming available in various supercomputing
centers (including Princeton Research Computing).
