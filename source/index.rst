AST560: Computational Plasma Physics 2021
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These are slides, notes and other materials for AST560 Spring 2021
course for the portion of the class taught by Ammar Hakim. These
lectures focus on finite-volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes for
partial differential equations (PDEs), specifically fluid mechanics
(Euler equations) and plasma physics (MHD equations, multi-fluid
equations and the Vlasov-Maxwell system). We will look at schemes
suited to shock dominated flows rather than problems on resistive
time-scales. Vast majority of laboratory, space and astrophysical
problems have complex interactions of shocks, turbulence and magnetic
fields and the schemes in these lectures will help you solve equation
to study such phenomena.

The final couple of lectures will be an introduction to implicit
methods to solve and couple diffusive and other non-ideal phenomena to
hyperbolic PDE solvers.
